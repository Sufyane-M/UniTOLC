**B. Purpose**
The `flashcards` table stores user-generated flashcards for spaced repetition learning. Each card contains a prompt (front), an answer (back), and metadata for tracking review schedules using the Leitner system. This enables users to efficiently memorize and review key concepts over time.

**C. Usage in Code**
‚ùó Not referenced in the codebase.

**D. Related Objects**
- The `user_id` column is a foreign key referencing `users(id)`.
- No views, functions, or triggers in the current schema or codebase are found to depend on `flashcards`.
