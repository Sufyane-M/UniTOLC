**A. Columns**

| Name        | Data type | Constraints & Defaults                                 | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id          | integer   | PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, DEFAULT nextval(...), auto-inc. | Unique identifier for each login record (serial/auto-incremented)     |
| user_id     | integer   | NOT NULL, FK → users(id)                               | The user who attempted to log in                                      |
| ip_address  | text      | NULL (optional)                                        | IP address of the login attempt                                       |

**B. Purpose**

The `user_login_history` table records each login attempt by users, including metadata such as IP address, user agent, and success status. It supports security auditing, analytics, detection of suspicious activity, and can be used for user support and compliance reporting.

**C. Usage in Code**

❗ Not referenced in the codebase.

*No direct or indirect usage was found in frontend, backend, scripts, tests, or configuration files. This table is currently unused.*

---

**D. Related Objects**

- **Foreign Keys**
  - `user_id` → `users(id)`  
    *Links each login record to a valid user, enforcing referential integrity.*

- **Indexes**
  - Primary key index on `id`
  - (Likely) index on `user_id` for efficient lookups (standard for FK columns, though not explicitly listed)

- **Relationships**
  - Intended to be used with users for security, analytics, and support
  - Could be referenced by future features for login monitoring, suspicious activity alerts, or compliance

- **Triggers, Views, Functions**
  - No triggers, views, or custom SQL functions directly reference this table (based on codebase and SQL search).

**E. Example Row**

| id | user_id | ip_address   | user_agent         | successful | created_at           |
|----|---------|-------------|--------------------|------------|----------------------|
| 1  | 42      | 192.168.1.1 | "Mozilla/5.0 ..."  | true       | 2024-06-01T12:00:00  |

**F. Notes & Best Practices**

- **Data Integrity:**  
  Foreign key constraints ensure login records are always linked to valid users.
- **Extensibility:**  
  The table is ready for future features such as login monitoring, suspicious activity alerts, or compliance reporting.
- **Auditability:**  
  The `created_at` timestamp, IP address, and user agent fields support detailed security and usage audits.
- **Usage:**  
  Currently unused, but well-structured for robust login tracking and security analytics.

**G. Summary**

- **Status:** Not referenced in the codebase (❗ unused table).
- **Role:** Intended for tracking user login attempts, supporting security, analytics, and compliance.
- **No triggers, views, or functions** depend on this table.
