**B. Purpose**
The `stripe_prices` table stores pricing information for products managed via Stripe. It maps Stripe price objects to local records, including currency, amount, recurrence details, and activation status. This enables the application to manage, display, and synchronize available subscription or product prices with Stripe.

**C. Usage in Code**
‚ùó Not referenced in the codebase.

**D. Related Objects**
- The `stripe_product_id` column is a foreign key referencing `stripe_products(stripe_product_id)`, establishing a relationship to the product this price belongs to.
- No views, functions, or triggers directly depend on `stripe_prices` in the current schema.

Note:
This table is currently unused in the application codebase. If you plan to implement dynamic pricing, product management, or Stripe integration, you may need to add logic in your backend and/or frontend to reference this table.
